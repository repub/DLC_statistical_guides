# Comparing Two Proportions

 Sometimes when we sample data from two populations we are interested in
whether those two populations differ on some binary (only two outcomes)
variable. For example, we may be interested if Democrat and Republican
senators vote differently (either yes or no) on a bill, or whether
smokers and non-smokers believe that cigarettes should be taxed to fund
health care (agree or disagree). For these questions we can compare the
population proportions with the following hypotheses:

 **Null hypothesis:** The proportions of the two variables are the
equal.
<center>
<i>H<sub>0</sub>: p<sub>1</sub> = p<sub>2</sub></i>
</center>

<br>

 <b>Alternative hypothesis:</b> The proportions of the two variables are
not equal. <br>
<center>
<i>H<sub>A</sub>: p<sub>1</sub> ≠ p<sub>2</sub></i>
</center>

<br>

 To statistically test the equality of two proportions the following
assumptions should be valid.

-   The data was gathered by **simple random sampling**
-   The two samples are **independent**
-   Both groups follow a **binomial distribution**

 To compare the proportions, a z-statistic is first calculated in the
equation:

![Z = \\frac{(\\hat{p\_1} - \\hat{p\_2})}{\\sqrt{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})(\\frac{1}{n\_1} + \\frac{1}{n\_2)}}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;Z%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%28%5Chat%7Bp_1%7D%20-%20%5Chat%7Bp_2%7D%29%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B%5Chat%7Bp%7D%281%20-%20%5Chat%7Bp%7D%29%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn_1%7D%20%2B%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn_2%29%7D%7D%7D "Z = \frac{(\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2})}{\sqrt{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2)}}}")
