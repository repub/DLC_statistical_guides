# One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA<sup>1</sup>)

The assumptions of the ANOVA<sup>1</sub> are:

- the data are **continuous**,
- the observations are **independent**,
- each factor is **approximately normally distributed**,
- there are no **significant outliers** or **high-leveradge points**,
- and the distributions of the factors have **equal variances**.

&emsp;If the assumption that the groups follow an approximately normal distribution is violated then rank-based, non-parametric tests, such as the [Kruskal-Wallis test](https://repub.github.io/DLC_statistical_guides/docs/Info/Kruskal-Wallis), may instead be valid.
