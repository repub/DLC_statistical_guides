# Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

&emsp;For data with a continuous response variable where we want to know the significance, magnitude, and direction of more than one predictor variable the single linear regression (SLR) model can be extended to a multiple linear regression (MLR) model.  While the response variable should be continuous (or continuous-like) the predictor variables can vary among many data types.  For instance, we may want to predict the height of trees (continuous) from the amount of water (continuous) and type of fertilizer (nominal) given.  Or, we could study how education level (ordinal), age (continuous), and gender (binomial) may predict income (continuous).  Like SLR, MLR has the same LINE assumptions:

* a **Linear relationship** exists between the response and predictor variables,
* and the residuals (errors) are **Independent**, approximately **Normally distributed**, and have **Equal variance (Homoscedasticity)**

In addition to the LINE assumptions, MLR models assume:

* there are **no significant outliers** or **high leverage points**,
* the observations are **randomly selected** from the population,
* and the independent variables have **little to no multicolinearity**.

&emsp;The assumption that the observations are randomly selected can be validated prior to fitting a MLR model, however the remaining assumptions generally must be assessed after the model has been fit.  Multicolinearity, which is colinearity among the predictor variables, can be determined by calculating variance inflation factors (VIFs) for each variable.  It is commonly considered that VIF values greater than 5 indicate moderate colinearity that should be explored, while VIFs greater than 10 indicate a problematic amount of colinearity that may affect the model and results.

&emsp;The LINE assumptions and the assumption of no significant outliers or high leverage points are typically assessed visually.  Unlike the SLR model which has one predictor, it is difficult to plot multiple predictors together to assess whether a linear relationship exists, so is typically assumed in MLR models unless there is reason not to.  The other assumptions can be assessed through diagnostic plots of the residuals.  These types of diagnostic plots can include plotting the residual errors against the fitted values, normal quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots, and Cook's distance plots (or plotting the residuals against their leverage).

&emsp;The MLR model formula is written as:

where <i>y<sub>i</sub></i> is the response for observation <i>i</i>, <i>&varepsilon;<sub>i</sub></i> is the error term for each observation <i>i</i>, <i>&beta;<sub>0</sub></i> is the intercept, <i>&beta;<sub>n</sub></i> is the regression coefficient (slope) for the independent variable <i>n</i>, and <i>x<sub>in</sub></i> is the value for the independent variable <i>n</i> at observation <i>i</i>.

&emsp;Both the significance of the overall model and of each independent variable is tested through an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).  The adjusted Sums of Squares (SS<sub>adj</sub>) is calculated for the whole model and for each independent variable (which sums to the SS<sub>adj</sub> for the overall model).  The F-statistics are then used to approximate p-values from the F-distribution.  Additionally, the 



&emsp;**Null hypothesis:** The estimated coefficient <i>&beta;</i> for variable *i* is equal to 0.

&emsp;**Alternative hypothesis:** <i>&beta;<sub>i</sub></i> is not equal to 0.
