# One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA<sup>1</sup>)

The assumptions of the ANOVA<sup>1</sub> are:

-   the data are **continuous**,
-   the observations are **independent**,
-   each factor is **approximately normally distributed**,
-   there are no **significant outliers** or **high-leveradge points**,
-   and the distributions of the factors have **equal variances**.

â€ƒIf the assumption that the groups follow an approximately normal
distribution is violated then rank-based, non-parametric tests, such as
the [Kruskal-Wallis
test](https://repub.github.io/DLC_statistical_guides/docs/Info/Kruskal-Wallis),
may instead be valid.
